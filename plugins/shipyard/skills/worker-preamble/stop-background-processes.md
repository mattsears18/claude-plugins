On-demand fragment of the `shipyard:worker-preamble` skill (see [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md) § "Stop background processes before returning"). Most dispatches never load this — the rule is a no-op unless you spawned a `Monitor` sub-task, a backgrounded `Bash` call, or a `TaskCreate` sub-Agent this session. Load it once you've spawned one of those and need the exact stop mechanism before you return.

If your worker spawned anything that lives **outside** the foreground tool-call lifecycle — a `Monitor` sub-task watching CI, a `Bash` call with `run_in_background: true` (e.g. a long-tail `gh pr checks --watch` you backgrounded so you could keep working in parallel), a `TaskCreate` sub-Agent — **stop it explicitly before you emit your terminal return string**. These processes belong to your session's background pool, not your "main turn," so the harness does not auto-reap them when your final assistant message lands. Each one will keep firing notifications (`<result>Still waiting (check 8)...</result>`, `<result>All historical background tasks have completed...</result>`) for the rest of its internal max-runtime (Monitors: 15–60 min; backgrounded bash: until the command exits or the shell is killed), and **every notification re-invokes the orchestrator for a no-op turn** because the parent agent is the wake target for everything spawned underneath it. The lightwork session that filed [#297](https://github.com/mattsears18/shipyard/issues/297) accumulated 50+ stale wake events across two fix-checks-worker dispatches that left their Monitor sub-tasks running after returning.

Apply this rule on **every** termination path — clean `green` / `shipped` / `rebased` / `noop:` returns, `blocked: <reason>` bails, and even the `reaped: ...` escape hatch (see [`reaped-escape-hatch.md`](./reaped-escape-hatch.md)). The notification leak is independent of whether the worker succeeded; what matters is that the worker spawned something whose lifetime exceeds its turn.

Mechanism per tool family:

| What you spawned | How to stop it before returning |
|---|---|
| `Monitor` sub-task (any subscription) | `TaskStop` against the task id you got back from `TaskCreate` / `Monitor` |
| `Bash` with `run_in_background: true` | `KillShell` against the shell id from the background-call's response (or `BashOutput` if you need the final exit code first, then `KillShell`) |
| `TaskCreate` sub-Agent that's still running | `TaskStop` against its task id |
| Foreground `Bash` (no `run_in_background:`) — e.g. `gh pr checks <M> --watch` | **Nothing** — foreground bash blocks your turn until it exits, so it can't outlive the return |

If you never spawned any of the above, this section is a no-op — the foreground-only path (the default) is already clean. The rule is "if you spawned it, you stop it"; it is NOT "always call TaskStop defensively at the end of every dispatch."

If `TaskStop` / `KillShell` errors (the process already exited on its own, the id was wrong, etc.), log an advisory and continue — the goal is best-effort cleanup, not blocking your return on a stop call that races against a process that was already done.
